### Backgrounds

- Use the Indie Web Camp logos on a solid background.
- Avoid using the Indie Web Camp logos on a textured or patterned background.
- If the background is dark, use the white Indie Web Camp logos.
- If the background is light, use the black Indie Web Camp logos.
- When possible, use the full color Indie Web Camp logos.


### Sizing

- When possible, use one of the vector versions of the Indie Web Camp logos logo for lossless resizing.
- If resizing makes the logotype ("Indie Web Camp" text) unreadable, use the logomark only version.
- Don't embiggen any of the PNGs.
- If you need a bigger PNG, embiggen a vector version then export it to PNG. (Or file an issue in this repo.)


### Spacing

- The Indie Web Camp logos must always have a margin around them.
- The margin is X.
- X is the height of the dot on the I in the IWC logomark.
- All of the Indie Web Camp logo files have this spacing built in, so you shouldn't need to calculate it.

## Dev Setup

To edit any of the text (though you probably shouldn't) or to add new text,
you'll need a typeface called Halis Grotesque (Halis GR).
